To do this, I used a form in the navbar.pug partial, which sends a GET request to the server with the search value as a query string.  Any of the words in the title can be used (for example just searching 'toy' would display toy story, 't' would display all the movies with a 't' in its title), cases are also ignored. However, I havent implemented searching by genre, year etc.",
